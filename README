NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::XSendFile - Catalyst plugin for lighttpd's X-Sendfile.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/XSendFile/;
        
    sub show : Path('/files') {
            my ( $self, $c, $filename ) = @_;
        
        # unless login, it shows 403 forbidden screen
            $c->res->status(403);
            $c->stash->{template} = 'error-403.tt';
        
        # serving a static file only when user logged in.
            if ($c->user) {
                $c->res->sendfile( "/path/to/$filename" );
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    lighty's X-Sendfile feature is great.

    If you use lighttpd + fastcgi, you can show files only set X-Sendfile
    header like below:

        $c->res->header( 'X-LIGHTTPD-send-file' => $filename );

    This feature is especially great for serving static file on
    authentication area.

    And with this plugin, you can use:

        $c->res->sendfile( $filename );

    instead of above.

    But off-course you know, this feature doesn't work on Catalyst Test
    Server (myapp_server.pl). So this module also provide its emulation when
    your app on test server.
